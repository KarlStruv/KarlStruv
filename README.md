# Hello! 👋
My name is Kārlis.
I am a passionate software developer.
You know what I like the most about being a programmer? The feeling after solving a problem or finishing a task which felt absolutely impossible at first.
Where do I feel I am at in Web Development? Give me enough time and I can build Facebook.

My skillset includes:
- PHP, JavaScript, SQL, HTML&CSS, C#, Lua
- MySQL, MSSQL
- Laravel, Symfony, Slim, Magento 2
- Wamp, Lamp, Mamp, Docker, Xampp
- Unit Testing
- OOP, MVC, SOLID & design patterns (KISS, DRY etc.)
- GIT
