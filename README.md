# Hello! 👋
My name is Kārlis Strūve.
I am a passionate software developer at Codelex.
You know what I like the most about being a programmer? The feeling after solving a problem or finishing a task which felt absolutely impossible at first.

My skillset includes:
- MySQL
- Laravel
- Unit & Integration testing (including TDD methods)
- MVC, SOLID & design patterns (KISS, DRY etc.)
- GIT
- Building REST API
- HTML & CSS, VueJS basics.
